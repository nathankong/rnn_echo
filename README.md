# Echo RNN (not echo state network)

To train the vanilla RNN to "echo" an input sequence:
```
python Train.py
```

To test the vanilla RNN on a new sequence:
```
python Test.py
```

To train the RNN implemented using tensorflow's API to "echo" an input sequence:
```
python Train_RnnCell.py
```

To test the RNN implemented using tensorflow's API on a new sequence:
```
python Test_RnnCell.py
```
